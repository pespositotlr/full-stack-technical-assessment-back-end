# full-stack-technical-assessment-back-end
An example back end project written in .NET Core

This was originally a coding test to give an example of building a full-stack project from scratch. It's using an XML file as its data store and React Redux as its front end (This is stored in a separate repository).

## Original assignment instructions (Specific information about the company has been removed): 
```
Full-Stack Technical Assessment: Create and deploy a simple, responsive single-page .NET web app

In this project, we’re looking for you to clearly demonstrate:

* Your understanding of Separation of Concerns in a multi-tier web app
* Your understanding of UI/UX best-practices when requirements, wireframes, or mockups are scarce or nonexistent
* Your understanding of MV* architecture (MVC, MVVM, etc.)
* Your understanding of SPA implementation
* Your ability to reliably deliver against your own level-of-effort/timeline estimate (be sure you consider how far you want to go to demonstrate the above before you commit to a delivery date)

Feel free to begin/complete Tasks 1-7 in whatever order you choose.

Task 1: Create a data store (your choice, whatever works) from the data and headers in the attached items.txt file (do not hardcode values in app code)

Task 2: Create a .NET web service endpoint that returns a list of max prices of items grouped by item name

Task 3: Create a .NET web service endpoint that takes as an input an item name and returns the max price for it

Task 4: create a .NET web service endpoint allow the user to create, update, or delete data in the data store

Task 5: Create and style a modern reactive Javascript-based UI (your choice of Angular, React, or Vue is fine, here) 
that allows a user to request the data from the web services in Tasks 2-4, 
and enables the user to allow the user to change data and view the entire data set in the data store via the UI.

Task 6: Deploy the web service to your choice of cloud-based hosting platform (Heroku, Azure, AWS, etc., whatever works for you) 
and provide us with the following:

a) URI or webpage we can use to directly test the Task 2-4 endpoints *without* going through the web app UI

b) URL of the web app consuming the API endpoints

Task 7: Commit all of your project code to your choice of code repository (Github, Azure Devops, etc., whatever works for you) and provide us with access to the code repo. It’s fine to make your repo public, for the sake of convenience.
